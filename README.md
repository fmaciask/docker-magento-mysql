# meanbee/magento-mysql

A Docker image for a MySQL server with configuration suitable for Magento installations.

# Supported tags

- [`latest` (MySQL 5.7)](https://github.com/meanbee/docker-magento-mysql/blob/master/Dockerfile)

# Usage

This Docker image is based on the official [MySQL 5.7 image](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/mysql/) and only adds configuration to `/etc/mysql/conf.d`, therefore the usage remains exactly the same as the parent image.
